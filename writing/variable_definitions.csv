Vitro_or_Vivo,Name,Definition
vivo,PLA,amount of drug found in plasma
vivo,ULU,amount of drug found in uninvolved lung
vivo,RIM,amount of drug found in Rim (of lesion) 
vivo,OCS,amount of drug found in outer caseum
vivo,ICS,amount of drug found in inner caseum
vivo,SLU,amount of drug found in standard lung
vivo,SLE,amount of drug found in standard lesion
vitro,cLogP,octanol:water partition coefficient. This is the logarithm of the concentration of drug in octanol (oil) and water - it's a measure of lipohilicity/hydrophoicity of the drug.
vitro,huPPB,"The fraction of drug concentration that binds to human plasma proteins, (1 - huPPB) is then the free concentration of the drug. "
vitro,muPPB,"the fraction of drug concentration that binds to mouse plasma proteins, (1-muPPB) is then the free concentration of the drug. "
vitro,MIC_Erdman,"Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of Erdman strain. This is the minimum drug concentration that inhibits the growth of the bacteria, in this case the Erdman strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. "
vitro,MICserumErd,"Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of Erdman Strain WITH serum added (serum added demonstrates a more similar to the environment the drug acts in, in-vivo). "
vitro,MIC_Rv,MIC for H37Rv strain of M. tuberculosis.
vitro,Caseum binding ,fraction of drug concentration that is bound to the constituents of the caseum (caseum is at the center of the necrotic granuloma) (% unbound)
vitro,MacUptake ,rate of uptake of drug molecules by macrophages. (I/E concentration ratio). MacUptake is unitless (I / E concentration ratio)--this could refer to concentrations inside and outside the macrophage I intracellular / E extracellular. The time at which the measurement is taken is probably a standard one.
