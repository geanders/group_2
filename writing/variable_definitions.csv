Bio_or_Chem,Name,Definition
bio,PLA,amount of drug found in plasma
bio,ULU,amount of drug found in uninvolved lung
bio,RIM,amount of drug found in Rim
bio,OCS,amount of drug found in outer caseum
bio,ICS,amount of drug found in inner caseum
bio,SLU,amount of drug found in standard lung
bio,SLE,amount of drug found in standard lesion
chem,cLogP,octanol:water partition coefficient. This is the logarithm of the concentration of drug in octanol (oil) and water - it's a measure of lipohilicity/hydrophoicity of the drug.
chem,huPPB,human plasma protein binding. The fraction of drug concentration that binds to plasma proteins. (1 - huPPB) is then the free concentration of the drug. % bound.
chem,muPPB,mouse plasma protein binding. % bound. 
chem,MIC_Erdman,minimum inhibitory concentration Erdman strain. This is the minimum drug concentration that inhibits the growth of the bacteria. In this case the Erdman strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
chem,MICserumErd,
chem,MIC_Rv,MIC for H37Rv strain of M. tuberculosis.
chem,Caseum binding ,fraction of drug concentration that is bound to the constituents of the caseum (caseum is at the center of the necrotic granuloma) (% unbound)
chem,MacUptake ,rate of uptake of drug molecules by macrophages. (I/E concentration ratio). MacUptake is unitless (I / E concentration ratio)--this could refer to concentrations inside and outside the macrophage I intracellular / E extracellular. The time at which the measurement is taken is probably a standard one.
